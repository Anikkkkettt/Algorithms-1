# Kadane's Algorithm 

This algorithm is used to compute the largest contiguous subarray sum. 

```
Consider the following example: 
a = {-2, -3, 4, -1, -2, 1, 5, -3}

Largest contiguous subarray sum is 7 and the required subarray is {4, -1, -2, 1, 5}
```

### Time Complexity 

O(n) where n is length of the array

### Space Complexity 

O(1) which means constant space
