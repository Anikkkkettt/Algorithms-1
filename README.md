# Algorithms
The home for algorithms ranging from searching and sorting all the way to dynamic programming algorithms, divide and conquer, etc.

## What are algorithms?

An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a computational problem in an optimal manner.
In computer science, there are various kinds of algorithms. Particularly in Data Structures, we have algorithms for sorting,
searching, etc.
This repo is made for all such algorithmic contributions.

## How to Contribute?

In order to contribute to this repo, just fork the repo and then clone it to your local machine, add a new folder for an algithm you want to contribute and then add the algorithm program along with a readme file describing the algo you added. For your convinience, i have added some sample algorithms.

## Which languge to use for contributing?

You can contribute in any Programming language as algorithms are language independent. 
All valid PRs will be merged in this project.
